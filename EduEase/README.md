EduEase üß†‚ú®
An AI-powered learning assistant that transforms dense educational YouTube videos into simple, accessible, and interactive study materials.
EduEase is designed with a core mission: to make learning accessible for everyone, especially students with cognitive and attention-related disabilities like Dyslexia and ADHD. By leveraging a powerful suite of AI models, our app deconstructs long video lectures into notes that are easy to read, listen to, visualize, and test.
The Problem
Traditional online learning, especially through video platforms like YouTube, presents significant barriers for students with learning disabilities. Long, unstructured content can be overwhelming, making it difficult to:
Maintain focus and attention.
Identify key concepts from conversational filler.
Recall information effectively.
Engage actively with the material instead of just passively watching.
Our Solution: EduEase üöÄ
EduEase tackles these challenges by providing a multimodal learning experience that caters to different learning styles and cognitive needs.
Simply paste a YouTube video URL, and EduEase generates a comprehensive and accessible study guide featuring:
üéß Audio Notes: An audio version of the generated notes, perfect for auditory learners or for reinforcing concepts on the go.
üé® AI-Generated Visual Summary: A unique, AI-generated image that provides a visual anchor for the video's main topic, helping to create strong memory associations.
üìù Simplified Text Notes: The core of the app, featuring:
Title & Summary: A quick overview and a simple, intuitive explanation.
Text-Based Flowchart: A clear, text-based diagram mapping out the core concepts.
Key Takeaways: A concise bulleted list of the most important information.
Mnemonics: Clever memory aids to help with retention of key facts.
üß† Interactive Flashcards: An AI-generated quiz is turned into interactive flashcards, allowing students to actively test their knowledge and reinforce learning through recall.
